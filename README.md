A java 2D game engine powered by OpenGL.

## 1. Progression

I have a [blog](https://n3roo.github.io/blog.html) on my website where I speak about the last changes. [Here](https://github.com/N3ROO/nero-engine/projects/1) is the todo list.

## 2. Project description

This is my most ambitious project yet. I plan to implement everything that I have learned in Computer Science these last years. I hope that the first version will be released this summer. To demonstrate the abilities of the engine I also plan to release a 2D game shooter and a physics scene.

**Libs used:**
- Jogamp: [glugen](https://jogamp.org/gluegen/www/), a tool which automatically generates the Java and JNI code necessary to call C libraries,
- Jogamp: [jogl](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/), Java binding for the OpenGL API,
- Apache : [log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in Logbackâ€™s architecture.

## 3. Contributing
